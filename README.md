# sparkdown
Markdown with spark: a framework for building media-rich interactive sites.

As the web evolves, skill with CSS and Javascript is increasingly required for stunning web design. Frameworks like Bootstrap have allowed for shortcuts, but are a sledge-hammer to the markup nut. Coding from scratch requires re-inventing the wheel, despite libraries like jQuery.

Markdown is successful because it allows HTML to be generated from a natural, distraction-free writing enviroment. The Sparkdown project aims to take that idea and expands it for the modern web, bringing easy media embed, style, and interaction all from a natural writing environment. All while being backwards-compatible.
